        <h2>Happy Eid Mubarak To You And Your Family.</h2>
        <P>Bakra Eid also known as Eid-ul-Adha is an important festival celebrated by Muslims across the world. Out of the two Eids, Eid al-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha, which are celebrated by Muslims, Bakra Eid is said to be holier. It is celebrated on at the end of Hajj, a yearly pilgrimage to Mecca which Muslims are required to embark on once in their live.</P><br>
        <p>Bakra Eid is also known as Sacrifice Feast as this day marks Prophet Ibrahim's devotion and faith in Allah. God had once asked Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice the dearest thing to him to prove his love and faith, and so Prophet Ibrahim decided to sacrifice his only son. When Prophet Ibrahim was about to kill his son, God sent his angel Jibra'il (Gabriel) to replace the son with a goat. And so, since that day Bakra Eid is celebrated to remember Prophet Ibrahim's faith in God. The festival is celebrated by sacrificing a male goat; it is divided into three portions-- the first part is given to relatives, friends and neighbours; the second to the poor and needy; the third is for the family. Delicious dishes like mutton biryani and mutton korma, and desserts like kheer and sheer khurma are prepared on this day. Here are some Eid-ul-Adha wishes, quotes, messages, SMS that you can send to your near and dear ones or you can even post them up on Facebook or on WhatsApp as your status to share with all. </p><br>
